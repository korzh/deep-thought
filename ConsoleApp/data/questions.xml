    <Content>Hi,

I'm taking over the installation task for EasyQuery from another member of the team. Other than running the executable are there any key steps that I need to follow. I looked in the documentation and didn't see anything about installation or customization. If you can point me to a link that would be great.

Thanks

    <Content>Hi 

We are planning to buy easy query for our application. But before finalizing it, we would like to make sure it fulfills our requirements.
I have played around with demo and it has met most of our requirements. The only challenge I am facing is that currently it shows all the entities of the database I've connected it to. Is there a way of showing a filtered list of entities of DB. For example, in our application, we want to expose the entities on the basis of some permission set.
Is there a way to achieve it?

    <Content>We have reviewed your product and believe it has most of the functionality that we want.  However, we are having difficulty implementing the controls and getting the desired visual results.  Do you have any additional documentation on things like displayed column names and how to set them in the XML schema file?  We assume that the fields displayed to the user don't have to match the database field names.  Also, do you have any contract services where we could just pay you to implement what we need?

Thank you,

I have a data model with just two entities and already setup the relationship in the data model editor, and show the query conditions panel to the end user and so far all works fine.

How can i define the result columns in code, if the user only add conditions from one entity, the generated sql is just "select * from entity1 where xxx '= ..........",  i need it to be "select * from entity1 inner join entity2 on a = b where xxx = ....."

    <Content>I am putting together a proof of concept/demonstration/evaluation for using Easy Query in an application. The ability to page and extend an IQueryable query is looking to be a requirement for the size of the database. I've found a how-to for creating the model from an Entity Framework context but not an example of using LinqQueryBuilder. Could you point me to some sample code - preferable for creating the query in code as well. I keep getting "No types from context are used in this query. Possibly it's a wrong context object?"

  <Question id="1cb01868-99ec-419f-8493-379ee66a52f6" title="Parsing out the Attribute Name">
    <Content>Hello,

We are using your easy query tool.  We dynamically create the data model.  We have the need to be able to manually parse the XML that the constructor creates:

&lt;Query id="c6ae792c-9c6e-4c34-9294-e4b42efa7d02" name=""&gt;
  &lt;Description /&gt;
  &lt;Columns /&gt;
  &lt;JustSortedColumns /&gt;
  &lt;Conditions linking="All"&gt;
    &lt;Condition class="SMPL" enabled="True" readOnly="False"&gt;
      &lt;Operator id="StartsWith" /&gt;
      &lt;Expressions&gt;
        &lt;Expr class="ENTATTR" id="VEA_7" /&gt;
        &lt;Expr class="CONST" type="String" kind="Scalar" value="ips" text="ips" /&gt;
      &lt;/Expressions&gt;
    &lt;/Condition&gt;
    &lt;Condition class="SMPL" enabled="True" readOnly="False"&gt;
      &lt;Operator id="StartsWith" /&gt;
      &lt;Expressions&gt;
        &lt;Expr class="ENTATTR" id="VEA_1" /&gt;
        &lt;Expr class="CONST" type="String" kind="Scalar" value="hello" text="hello" /&gt;
      &lt;/Expressions&gt;
    &lt;/Condition&gt;
  &lt;/Conditions&gt;
&lt;/Query&gt;

I have attached a copy above.  We are able to parse this no problem,  but have reached a point of confusion about how to get meaningful names from the element:

&lt;Expr class="ENTATTR" id="VEA_1" /&gt;

We have tried to set these ID's in our own code at the point we create the data model,  to no avail:

EntityNameAttr.ID = "Test"

Hence,  by question is,  how do I set the ID and interpret the ID in the model?

I have attached our class at the bottom,  we use this to create the model.

Our subscription if finished so please let me know how you wish to bill us for your time.

Thanks
Rich

    <Content>Hi

I've built a solution based on the Adhoc Reporting demo. I've implemented the ColumsBar and ColumnsPanel as such:

    window.easyQuerySettings = {
...
...
        columnsBar: {
            allowAggrColumns: true,
            attrElementFormat: "{attr}",
            titleElementFormat: "{attr}",
            showColumnCaptions: true,
            adjustEntitiesMenuHeight: false,
            menuOptions: {
                showSearchBoxAfter: 30,
                activateOnMouseOver: true
            }
...

...
                &lt;div class="columns-block"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="columns-caption"&gt;Columns:&lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div id="ColumnsBar"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div id="ColumnsPanel"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
...

In my data model I have multiple nested (sub) entities. i.e.: Movies &gt; Casts &gt; Persons

When I add the Persons.FName column from my Persons entity, the full list of parent entities are shown in the column caption, i.e "Movies Casts Persons FName"

Is there a way to only display the selected column's caption / alias instead of the complete hierarchy? For example I only want to display "FName" as apposed to "Movies Casts Persons FName"

Thanks in advance

    <Content>Hi.

We are currently evaluating EasyQuery, trying to see if it fits our AdHoc reporting needs.

We have a few questions, which we hope you'll be able to answer.
1. In our system, we have a set of predefined "data sources", i.e. predefined sql joins, that a user can select to limit the tables he can see for selecting fields in his report. Is this something that can be supported using EasyQuery? 
2. We also show all fields or some them, depending on whether a user is working in "simple" or "advanced" mode. Can this be supported? 
3. Can we programmatically add hidden filters to a report?
4. Can we create queries using "group by" sql statements?
5. Can we export a report as PDF?

3- in the chart, the X axis sometimes only allow for text not numeric value
4- we have custom columns for start period and end period, for example (201701,201703) first 4 digits for the year and last two digits for the month, and this example means the first quarter of 2017. can we custom this output by adding some modification on the code behind if we have the license?

EasyQuery Questions:

1. Is ASP.NET going to stop at 3.9 release and .NET Core 4.0 be the focus moving forward.
2. Say I don't want to use your desktop data modeler but want the option to build a SSAS tabular object model (TOM):
    a. Can I hook it into EasyQuery directly?
    b. Can I hook it into EasyQery data model using DBGate component?
    c. What is the DBGate component?
    d. Does you data model export to an SSAS tabular model?

Let me explain:  Looking for a way to allow "power users" to use SSAS model and connect directly in Excel's PivotReport  AND use the same SSAS model to connect to EasyQuery for the "regular users".

Do you have any better ideas to achieve my business solutions for both user sets?

    <Content>Hi Sergie,

We are using easy query full license version, we are using the data model created using DME. We want to implement a unique data filter feature in the tool that while generating the query the result will display data applicable only to the respective users who runs the easy query. To achieve this we plan to add a mapping table that contains user id and data applicable to that user. We want to know if there is any way to add the user ID when the query fires in the back end, this condition should not be visible to the user creating the query but should only fire in the database. Also for certain tables this filter may not be required when user selects only these tables the condition should not be added. Can you please provide any suggestions to implement this feature.

  <Question id="31d1599b-a2ab-4fee-b484-772dc7365107" title="Generated SQL appears inconsistent and not always correct">
    <Content>Hi, we're experiencing some issues with the generated SQL from EasyQuery which results in unexpected results. Two cases we've found are as follows.

1. Linked tables do not always have join types respected in a query.
As an example, say we have a table Product with a link to another table ProductType on field ProductTypeID using an outer left join. Product also has an attribute ProductTypeName, that maps into ProductType.Name.

If then attempting to generate a query using just them ProductTypeName as a column, then the join is ignored and instead a SQL generated that just pulls all Name entries from all ProductType records. Adding any other column into the query causes the correct behaviour to be produced whereby the join is respected.

One column - incorrect SQL that ignores the join:
SELECT ProductType.Name AS "Product ProductTypeName" 
FROM dbo.ProductType AS ProductType

Two columns - SQL that respects the join exists albeit backwards:
SELECT ProductType.Name AS "Product ProductTypeName", Product.Abstract AS "Product Abstract" 
FROM (dbo.ProductType AS ProductType
RIGHT OUTER JOIN dbo.Product AS Product ON (Product."ProductTypeID" = ProductType."ProductTypeID" ))

This means that if a user tries to list only product type names of all products they are instead presented with a list of all product type names in existence, which is obviously not the same thing.


2. Column order flips left and right joins.
When adding in columns via the QueryColumnsPanel, the order in which the appear affects the generated SQL in such a way that the logic of the query is altered resulting in inconsistent data on execution. As an example if we have two columns, each representing a join to another table, then reversing the order these appear in the columns list impacts the logic of the query. This doesn't feel right as it means that our end users will have their results impacted depending upon what order they choose to select their columns. What if Bob wants column order AB but Jane wants BA? The data they return should be identical, just with the columns the other way round, but it is not. The data returned is different in these cases because the generated SQL is different.

As a functional analyst of Digicreate.be, I'm currently looking into some possible solutions to implement into our current application. We are in need of a advanced query builder and looking into the demo I have noticed a lot of functionality I'm looking for is in your software. Would a be possible to have a full trial version for 15 days? We would like to experiment with the tool and setup a POC before we purchase a license. 

Also we would be interested into a live demo - conference call so the lead developer and the product owner can follow this session aswel. This way we can already analyse and ask question we might have about the program. 

You can contact me by phone (0032479362661) or mail (thomas@digicreate.be).

Thanks a lot in advance. Looking forward to your fast response.

  <Question id="3704cab7-b745-49d4-88dd-fe00c2e35a57" title="How to change the use of table names in column headers">
    <Content>Hello.  I am trying to implement a change that was requested by an end-user.

The default behavior of EasyQuery appears to be to prepend the table name to the beginning of each column header.  For example, if a query includes the field "Field_A" from table "Table_1", the column header in the output will read "Table_1 Field_A".  The end user-would like this default behavior to be modified to either (1) remove the table name from the resulting column header, or (2) change the prepended table name to a (predefined) shortened version of the table name (e.g. "T1"), and replace the space with an underscore ("_").

Can you tell me if this behavior is possible in EasyQuery?

    <Content>Good afternoon,

We are planning to buy the EasyQuery solution to use it in our project in the company where I work.
Before, they ask me to "play" with the trial version to see if it matches our need.

I am dealing with localisation now. I try to use my own files like those in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Korzh.NET\res\EasyQuery" :

- EQCoreMessages.properties
- EQWebMessages.properties

I created a copy of the files and try to load them in my Controller's Constructor like this :

Korzh.EasyQuery.TextResources.LoadFromFile(dataPath + "/MyCustomFileWithMyTranslation.properties");

There are no build or execution error, I tested in case the location of the file it is OK but Nothing happened, it did not use my translation.

Do I forget Something ?

Second point, where can I translate with my own translation the UI widget sentences, like "[Add new column]" in the query panel or "Select records where all of the following apply" in the condition pannel ?

Thank you for your answer,
Cordially,

    <Content>Hi team

I want to limit the query results to only those entities which have location within permissible locations. For this I have used following code snippet:

foreach (var table in tables)
            {
                var tableNameArr = table.FullName.Split(' ');
                if (tableNameArr.Count() &gt; 0)
                {
                    bool hasLocationColumn = table.Links.Any(l =&gt; l.Table1.FullName.StartsWith("dbo.Locations") || l.Table1.FullName.StartsWith("dbo.Locations"));
                    if (hasLocationColumn)
                    {
                        query.ExtraConditions.AddSimpleCondition(table.Alias + ".LocationId", "InList", permissibleLocations);
                    } 
                }
            }

            eqService.LoadOptionsDict(optionsDict);

            var sql = eqService.BuildQuery(query, optionsDict);

            var resultSet = eqService.GetDataSetBySql(sql);

            var resultSetDict = eqService.DataSetToDictionary(resultSet, optionsDict);

It is working just fine. The only problem is that the condition once added is not removed and the same condition is added again while executing the query second time. I am not saving the temporary query(with the extra condition) anywhere. How is it retaining the condition? What am I doing wrong?</Content>

    <Content>Hi,

While asp.net view gets loaded all the entities get loaded at once i.e. all tables from the context get loaded.

We have a scenario where we don't want user to be shown with all the tables but only those tables should be visible who are associated with the report.

Ex:

InvoiceReport - is created from Table Invoice, then only Invoice table must be loaded under the + sign to add/edit the table columns.</Content>

  <Question id="55fff0a5-2508-43d4-9009-5df3b97dc10e" title="Issues with Entitiy Framework">
    <Content>Hello,

I've downloaded and attempted to implement your example for ASP.Net and EntityFramework, and I have run into some issues. If I try to query a single table, everything works as expected. As soon as I add a column from an associated table, that's when things fall apart, and I don't really understand why, or what I can do to fix it. 

For example: I have two related items, Client and ClientSetting. Client has an ID on it called Id. ClientSetting has a Key, a Client ID (which references the ID on Client as a Foreign Key), and the value for the setting. When I add just the client name to the query builder, it works fine, and outputs a query to the SQL window, and I can run it. As soon as I add a field from ClientSetting, the query disappears and when I run it, I get an exception. The SQL generated when i check it in the back end is: SELECT Client.Name AS [Client Name], ClientSetting.Value AS [ClientSetting Value] 
FROM (AssetEmsEntities.Clients AS Client
     INNER JOIN AssetEmsEntities.ClientSettings AS ClientSetting ON (Client.ClientId  = ClientSetting.Id ))

ClientSetting has no id field. Client doesn't have a ClientId field, it has an Id field. It's almost as if it's reading the tables and then mixing up the fields each table has (Client has an Id field and ClientSetting has ClientId, not vice versa). 

Is this a common problem, or one that is easily fixable?

    <Content>Hello,

I came across with your product while doing research on the internet.
While looking at its features I would like to use the MVC QueryBuilder in one of my customer project.
However, I need to do more from what the demo sample offers. Here is what I need;
* I need to take "Title" text for the "Columns" from the datasource that I want. The sample automatically creates alias from the combination of table name and physical column name. I will give data source for this. I just want to know if this is possible. 
* Although it looks possible to load saved query and execute, the sample didn't work for me. http://demo.easyquerybuilder.com/asp-net-mvc/
* I would like to give alias to table name as I did for column. I will give datasource for the table name as well.

Is it possible to create a custom function where the user can specify which columns to use as the parameters?

    <Content>Hi there, 

We are interested in buying the Easy Query Control and We have been testing out the trial version. We use WebForm .Net 3.5

There are few questions we would like to clarify:

1. Can the EntitiesPanel be resized with JQuery or Javascript? if so, do you have any sample code?

2. Is there a convenient way add a search box to search a column in the EntitiesPanel?

3. In the QueryColumnsPanel, can the result columns move up or down by simple drag and drop?

4. In the QueryColumnsPanel, can the actions (Sorting, Move to top, Move up, Move down etc) drop down be split into two or more separate buttons?

5. What is the main difference between the trial and full version? I have been trying out different things and when it didn't work out, I wasn't sure if I have done it right or it is just because there are limited things you can do in the trial version.

6. What are the main improvements of the 4.5 version compare to 4.0 and 3.5?

We are looking forward to your response.

    <Content>I have an order table and a salesman table. An order is taken by a salesman.

I can then write a query to select from orders where salesman = john or select from orders where salesman = david

Thats all fine but if i want to write a query which has a where salesman = x, and send the xml to a user to run, i want X to be whoever they are

So if dave runs it the query will be where salesman = dave but if john runs it then the where will be sales=john, so i only need to have one query definition

The only option i can think it add a salesman to the list of salesman called "YOU" and then search and replace the SQL before i run it and insert in the salesman name of whoever is running it

    <Content>Hi,

I have to say I am very impressed with your speed of responses to questions and delivery of solutions!

At the moment, users can select entities that are not associated in any way to each other. Understandably this results in a cross join which ultimately times out.
I was wondering if there is a way that we could hook into the checkbox state changed event of the entities, interrogate the relationships setup for the selected entity (defined in the DataModel xml) and control which of the remaining unselected entities we keep visible for the user to interact with?

Kind Regards,

  <Question id="697a2e4b-b4a1-4226-8e68-2f2b301be651" title="WPF MVVM Adding Columns to Query">
    <Content>Hello,

We are going to add Columns to a Query via some saved data elsewhere in our project.

We have a ViewModel, using MVVMLight.  DbModel, DbQuery, and SqlQueryBuilder are Properties of this ViewModel.

On a method, we run the following code.

                var attr = CurrentModel.EntityRoot.FindAttribute(EntityAttrProp.Expression, "PART.NUM");
                if (attr != null)
                {
                    var c = new DbColumn(attr.Description, SortDirection.None);
                    c.Expr = new DbEntityAttrExpr(CurrentModel, attr);
                    CurrentQuery.Columns.Add(c);
                }
            
            var newC = CurrentQuery;
            CurrentQuery = null;
            RaisePropertyChanged("CurrentQuery");
            CurrentQuery = newC;
            RaisePropertyChanged("CurrentQuery");      


However, the Columns,Sorting,Filtering display does not update with the newly added column. Only through manipulation with the Query Interface will the column appear.

How do we add columns from code?

I have a question around the order of attributes in the column section.
When I arrange a date type attribute verses a non-date type attribute, I'm seeing my results returned to be much different.
I see that the joins generated by the tool are generated in the order of the columns entered.
Is this general tool behavior?

I've attached a few examples of what I'm seeing.

3.     Is Working
4.	Location Name
5.	Address
6.	City

    <Content>Hi there.

I have made good progress with EasyQuery

Example...imagine this scenario

Table: D_LOCATION
Column 1: LOC_NAME - string
Column 2: LOC_TYPE_CODE - int

Table: R_LOC_TYPE_CODE
Column 1: LOC_TYPE_CODE - int
Column 2: LOC_TYPE_NAME - string

In the Data Model Editor I have simplified it for my users, for example

Location
...Name
...Type

If my user selects to display Name and Type columns from Location, I want to show Name string and Type string (not int).  I know how to use the Value Editor, but this for the SELECT portion. I thought it had to do with "Lookup attribute" but that doesn't seem to do anything.

Please email and I can provide more info if necessary.

    <Content>Hello Sergiy,
finally the purchase process is done.

As related in the previous ticket, we must look at how to install the WS in own infrastructure.
1. as a nodejs component (packaged in app or as a ws)
2. as your WS installed in a .NET docker container

As you said in the previous ticket https://korzh.com/account/Ticket/Details/1837 :

"However, since Node.JS is totally new platform for us we are very interested in delivering our library on it - we are ready to provide you with installable version of SqlQueryBulider web-service with Team license as well."

So, can you declare my account to be able to download the EasyQuery for ASP.NET Core Team license sources and also the WS?

My first steps are to understand the code and to estimate the effort to swith to a NodeJS version.
But perhaps you have started something since own last discussion exchange was 3 monthes ago ?

  <Question id="807bc11b-44e8-47e6-a15d-6c613b7726ce" title="Trying MVC...">
    <Content>Opened a new ticket:

Basically gave up on ASP.NET Web Forms &amp; AJAX (original and marriage of web service/jquery.)   Though functionality could be achieve the widgets insisted on repainting parts of screen under all button click circumstances.  On the data was truely AJAX.  This was annoying.  Even tried to use Telerik tools to mute repaints on button/widgets/controls and was not successful.

So, though a bit of newbie in MVC, gave the product a try and found that it responds properly on the screen.  Can leverage most of backend code too.  

Only problem is you have "extra" functionality there like "Columns Sorting" - DO NOT WANT in widget, and hope to find a "easyQuerysettings" to turn it off.

One thing this product needs is a more robust way to getting a bunch query lists loaded into the UI without the "mini progress bar" showing so much.  I've done a ton of things in SQL to optimize this for improvement (seperate distinct data, put indexes on table, create view indexes, etc.)   It improves things a tad but still drags on your end.  Any ideas on your end would be appreciated.  We are talking about select distincts (one value) and selects (two values) for listboxes in "conditions widget"  Just too sluggish and do not want to hard code in application.

Thanks,

    <Content>Good morning.

We are interested in your product (in the Company License) and before purchasing it we have a couple of questions.

1. Does the plugin allows you to implement a security framework so that people that use easyquery don't have Access to do some queries regarding specific table values in the Database?

2. We have a requirement when exporting to Excel that for specific columns we cannot repeat the row. For example, we have a Table called "Process" and other table with "Approvers". Instead of having:

Process ID     Process Name    Approver Name
1                     Process Master  John Doe
1                     Process Master  Foo Fighters

I need in the Excel report the following in a single row

Process ID     Process Name    Approver Name
1                     Process Master  John Doe; Foo fighters

    <Content>Hi there,

I'm trying to see if I can use this tool to do adhoc reports on a site that uses Umbraco as well as some custom data. I have the following query and would love to be able to use this as a Virtual Attribute value (it pulls a Member name from the umbraco contentxml table). So I'd like to have my custom table, with a Virtual Attribute called MemberName and have it populated with the following query.

SELECT e.FullName as QASpecUser
FROM(SELECT m.v.value('@id', 'int') as nodeId, m.v.value('(/Member/firstName)[1]', 'nvarchar(100)') + ' ' + m.v.value('(/Member/lastName)[1]', 'nvarchar(100)') As FullName 
FROM(SELECT CAST(xml as xml) as col1 from cmsContentXml) t CROSS APPLY col1.nodes('/Member')m(v)) e Where e.NodeId = MyCustomTable.MyMemberId

Can you provide any insight as to the best approach for doing this? Ideally I'd like to have it as an attribute/column on MyCustomTable instead of a user having to select columns from MyCustomTable and then select MemberName from other table.

  <Question id="926709f3-6ae9-42a7-a9bb-ce2f4643d40c" title="Problem with query being created correctly">
    <Content>I have built a query using the KORZH web interface. I will send a screen shot as an attachment if it allows me to.
I'm trying to Sum a field however I'm not getting the result I am expecting. How do I fix this?

As you can see the last select item that your application wrote should be a sum but it's not writing it correctly. 
I would expect the last select item to be somethnig like the following

SUM(SS_Inventory.Cost) AS "Inventory Cost Sum" 
instead it is writing 
REPLACE(SS_Inventory.Cost, RIGHT(SS_Inventory.Cost, 0), '' ) AS "Inventory Cost Sum" 

this is obviously giving me the wrong answer.

Here is the entire query being generated by your application.

SELECT SS_Inventory.Mfg AS "Inventory Manufacturer", 
SS_Inventory.Part_Number AS "Inventory Part #", 
SS_Inventory.Description AS "Inventory Description", 
COUNT(SS_Inventory.Part_Number) AS "Inventory Quantity", 
REPLACE(SS_Inventory.Cost, RIGHT(SS_Inventory.Cost, 0), '' ) AS "Inventory Cost", 
REPLACE(SS_Inventory.Cost, RIGHT(SS_Inventory.Cost, 0), '' ) AS "Inventory Cost Sum" 
FROM dbo.SS_Inventory AS SS_Inventory
WHERE
(
  SS_Inventory.Quantity &gt; 0 AND 
  CASE WHEN SS_Inventory.InventoryYN ='0' THEN 'No' WHEN SS_Inventory.InventoryYN = '1' THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'N/A' END = 'Yes' AND

3- I assume EasyQuery is executing the SQL that is shown. The SQL seems to be not editable.  For experienced users I would like them to be able to enter and run their own SQL, it this possible if they known the structure of the tables?

    <Content>I think I may have asked this before, but is it possible to modify the aggregate functions that are available for each attribute?  By data type?  Is it possible to modify the aggregate functions themselves?

I'm currently running into an issue where in Oracle, the AVG function is returning values that cannot be bound to C# objects due to a precision issue. This occurs when you get a repeating decimal (ex: 2/3) for a decimal average.  All of the information I've found online suggests modifying the query to include rounding for an appropriate level of precision.

Ideally, I'd be able to configure each individual numerical attribute to be allowed different aggregate functions.  Some numerics make no sense to be summed or averaged (numeric identifiers, for example). 

Any information you can provide would be great!</Content>

I would also need to be able to restrict which data users can access e.g. if there is a table called posts the user should only be able to see posts where the UserID is theirs and if there is a table called comments the user should only be able to see comments for posts where the post's UserID is theirs.

Please can you let me know if these things are possible?

    <Content>Hello, can not guess how to query data using Ef Code first using dataContext as a model.
And your example https://korzh.com/easyquery/docs/use-cases/building-dynamic-queries-with-easyquery-and-entity-framework seems out of date cos some of methods marked obsolete. Can you provide new example or check my code: 
here's how i load model:
 dataModel.LoadFromContext(typeof(mm));  //mm is DbContext

...
  query = new DbQuery();
            query.Model = dataModel;
...then everything like in sample...

void SetSql()
        {
          
            try
            {
            
                EntitySqlQueryBuilder builder = new EntitySqlQueryBuilder(query);
                /*   if (!builder.CanBuild)
                       return;*/    //ALWAYS FALSE!


                builder.BuildSQL();
                string sql = builder.Result.SQL;
                textBoxSql.Text = sql;   // SQL always ended up with "..FROM AS"             
         
            }

So example of quering is mot working for sure cos we have incorrect sql.
Also i have a question - can we query EF repository in this case or just SQL statement? 
Thank you!

    <Content>Good Afternoon,

I have a use case I wonder if you could help me with.

We have a field that is encrypted in the database,  so all that is there is a hash.  However,  in the query the user may enter the real value (for example a card number 4775123456789 etc).

What I would like to do is trap the even in either the query build or as the user updates,  so I can swap this value to the hashed value in the query.  Only for a given field though.

I can get a bit creative on string manipulation on the final query,  as I know the field names,  but I imagine there is a more elegant way to do this by overriding something somewhere for the value.

Could you lend me your thoughts?

  <Question id="c3fedc67-2d2b-404d-b7a3-b63c8bb12c01" title="Security Question">
    <Content>Hello,

This is in regard to the MVC (.NET Core) library.  Is there any validation that occurs when the Execute Search button is clicked (on client and/or server end)?  My concern would be if someone were to modify the query on the client side, and run a query that they shouldn't be allowed to run.  Is there any possibility for someone to drop/update/delete from tables?  All of SQL is executed through the EqService, so I don't have the ability to check into that.

My app will be pretty locked down to select users, and the user they'll be running under restricted rights from a DB user standpoint.  But I just want to make sure the security is buttoned up on the client/server end.

Thanks,

    <Content>Hi,

We have recently purchased EasyQuery for WinForms and while it's working great I'm having  an issue in using the value editor.
I've defined views (SQL Server 2012 in the DB) and added these as entities to my model in the Data Model Editor.
I can successfully create a query using the .NET EasyQuery component and execute this query.
However, I can't get the value editor to work.
I want to define a SQL List so under settings I've entered a standard query to my lookup table (e.g. Select Value, Text from table_name).
When I change the operator to "is equal to" and I try to click on the [select value] nothing happens?
Do I have my SQL List query defined correctly?

Thanks,

    <Content>Hi,

Newbie to KORZH. Just followed the get starting guide. Have copied from EQMvcDemoLinq.NET45, EasyQueryController and EasyQuery view.
Added all necessary references to my project and have the following in my controller constructor.

            _eqService = new EqServiceProviderDb
            {
                StoreModelInSession = true,
                StoreQueryInSession = true,
                SessionGetter = key =&gt; Session[key],
                SessionSetter = (key, value) =&gt; Session[key] = value,
                //DataPath = System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath("~/App_Data"),
                ContextType = typeof(DmdModelContext),
                ContextGetter = () =&gt; new DmdModelContext(),
            };

The DmdModelContext is an EF6 code first data model. Backend is an Azure MS SQL 2016 database. Running Visual Studio 2013.

My page runs OK without error, but am seeing no entities listed. Please advise 
How does the Data Model Editor generated XML file fit into the picture (so I can control which database views are exposed)?
How do I ensure that all queries returned are limited to what the logged in user can see; i.e. add where clause to apply to the generated SQL before executed.
How can I save allow the user to save a query they have generated for future reference, like a template?

Kind Regards,

  <Question id="ed0b3bb4-92b8-4805-827d-3133262c36d7" title="Technical questions for using easy query">
    <Content>Hi,

We are planning to purchase easy query company license for our application but we have certain requirements for which we need to be sure if it can be done directly through easyquery or by modifying it's source code. The requirements are as follows

In our project we have entities like Project, Jobs, Tasks etc which are location based, for eg we have project - say 'P1' for location Hongkong and Project 'P2' belonging to location Hongkong and Project 'P3' for location China. The users logging into application and using reports also belong to certain location(s) , for eg User 'U1' can belong to Hongkong or China or both.

Now when user builds a query using easyquery the result set must be filtered on locations to which user belongs, say for User 1, the project report must filter projects for location Hongkong and China. 

1) So using query builder how can we achieve this ?
2) Based on my research, I have found that above can be done using TableValued functions as entities, but querybuilder only displays tables and views, so can we modify querybuilder to also display TableValuedFunctions instead of just tables and functions, and generate SQL accordingly

3) Is there a provision to have SQL generated, getting parsed in to c# objects ?

4) There is also a requirement that entities displayed should be based on user having permissions, that is only those entities should be displayed for which user has permissions to read. Also after a report has been created and saved in database only those reports should display results where user has permission on all it's entities.

Please let me know if above is possible to do using easyquery, you can also setup a meeting to understand requirements and let us know about technical feasibility of it before we make a final decision to purchase company license.

    <Content>Hi 

Model is made on physical tables and we hide many fields/attributes in our model and those fields are present in actual tables.
Now when you do not select any column and just set condition on any table / entity " select * " is added automatically in our query. Executing this query shows all fields from table even those which are kept hidden from user.

I think its a bug and fields which are not in model should not be shown in result.
Please change it and if no field/attribute is selected in COLUMNS panel, please select only the fields we used in conditions panel.

  <Question id="fcc127ce-0081-4530-b928-58bfaf31d80a" title="Existing SQL Conversion and Oracle SQL variables">
    <Content>Hi Korzh team,
I am a developer at Mastercard evaluating EasyQuery for an internal app where Oracle SQL modifications need to be made by business owners who are less technical savvy. So far EasyQuery is looking like a good fit for most of our needs. However, I have a few questions:
1) Is it possible to pull in existing SQL (specifically from Oracle if that matters) and convert it to pre-selected columns and conditions in the EasyQuery interface just like if you pulled in saved XML? If so, can you explain how this is done with code examples?
2) Is there a way to use variables (Example: “select * from table where column = :variableName”)? Is this something that would have to be added as a custom created conditional statement or implemented in a different fashion?
I look forward to hearing from you.
Thanks,
Scott
